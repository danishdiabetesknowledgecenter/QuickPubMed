### Start developing
- You're ready to start creating featuresüëå
  
## Branching Strategy

Follow the feature branch strategy for adding new features.
```
main (deployment branch) ‚Üê‚Üê dev(consolidate features) ‚Üê‚Üê feature/<name-of-feature>
```
*Notice: Avoid pushing directly to the main branch, this is currently not enforced by rules since the repository is private*


### Naming conventions for shortlived branches 

- *Bug fixes*
  - bug/name-of-bug (or github issue id)
- *Features*
  - feature/name-of-feature


### Creating a Pull Request (PR)
When multiple people are working on a project it is common practice to consolidate features on the dev branch before a deployment is triggered.

1. Push your feature branch to GitHub
2. Go to repository on GitHub
3. Click "Pull requests" ‚Üí "New pull request"
4. Select:
   - Base: `dev` (for feature merges)
   - Compare: `feature/your-feature-name`
5. Fill in:
   - Title: Brief description of changes
   - Description: Detailed explanation of changes
   - (*optional*) Reviewers: Assign team members for review
   

#### PR Best Practices
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Include tests if applicable
- Reference related issues
- Update documentation if needed


## Deployment and release of new version

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The project uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

When a feature (or multiple consolidated features) should be deployed:

1. Create PR from `dev` to `main`
2. Review and merge PR (include relevant info in title and description)
3. [Create a new release, with a new tag](https://github.com/danishdiabetesknowledgecenter/QuickPubMed/releases)
4. The new release will trigger the GitHub Actions automatically which will:
   - Build the application
   - Deploy to the FTP server
   - Only the `dist` folder is deployed which contains the bundled code 

[The deployed app can be viewed here](https://qpm.videncenterfordiabetes.dk/dev/latest/)

### GitHub Secrets
The workflow uses the following secrets for secure deployment:
- `FTP_SERVER`: FTP server address
- `FTP_USERNAME`: FTP account username
- `FTP_PASSWORD`: FTP account password

To add/update secrets:
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Navigate to Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add required secrets

Furthermore make sure that the enviroment varibels defined in the main.yml are created as [Secrets in GitHub](https://github.com/danishdiabetesknowledgecenter/QuickPubMed/settings/secrets/actions)


## Notes
- The application is built using Vue 2 and Vite 5
- Deployment is configured for static hosting
- Build artifacts are optimized for production

### Managing tasks for open-source or internal work 
All GitHub repositories have a tab for creating and managing [issues](https://github.com/danishdiabetesknowledgecenter/QuickPubMed/issues)

Use this to report bugs or request new feature. These issues can be directly linked to a branch and resolved when a branch is merged into dev.
